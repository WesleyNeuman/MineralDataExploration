# MineralDataExploration
Project for learning data preparation and exploration methods in Python

This project uses the "Mineral Ores around the world" dataset found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/ramjasmaurya/mineral-ores-around-the-world

Up until now, I've done all of my data science projects in SAS. As I make the switch to Python, the first thing I need to focus on is my ability to work with data in ways that are code-efficient and performance-efficient. 

This dataset looks simple and clean, so it's an excellent option for me to begin with. This project would be better executed through using a notebook (I did pull it from Kaggle...) and I intend to migrate my work to Jupyter after I'm done. However, I'm developing a package in tandem with this project containing data manipulation functions I believe I will use often (found here: https://github.com/WesleyNeuman/WesleysPythonToolkit). Therefore, keeping everything on my machine is convenient.
